<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kosisochukwu, I am from the eastern part of Nigeria. I am in my mid twenties, currently doing my one year mandatory NYSC service.
  I currently work in an Insurance company and run a fabric business by the side. With no background knowledge on IT, I recently joined the tech world.
Tech has always been a facinating field for me, it is something I have always wanted to venture into but had limited opportunity and little knowledge. 
Finally I found my way into learning it. I am happy to finally become a web developer. Looking forward to learning more, developing more and gaining more experience.</p>
